# This is Serhii firts git project!
**1.** In this short project, I learned to use Git to manage and track  project folders.
**2** I set up remote storage on GitHub and then copied it to a local machine.
**3** Once this repo was installed locally, I was able to use Git to save files and folders.
**4** After changing the project, I moved the local repo to GitHub to share it with everyone!
